What is this app?
This app lets you create and save NBA All-Star teams, seperated by conference (West and East). You can choose which players
you want in each team. The players are ordererd by position (two guards and three forwards) and were selected for your choosing
based off of being an NBA All-Star during the 2018-2019 season and being an NBA All-Star candidate during the 2019-2020 season.
The teams created can be saved on the each respective Create Your Team page and if you want a blank screen again you can reset
the teams. 

Is anything broken? What's wrong?
I don't believe anything is broken at its current state.
