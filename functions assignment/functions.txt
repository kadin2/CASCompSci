i. What keyword does Swift use to mark the definition of a function? (Think like def in. Python and function in JavaScript.)

Swift uses 'func.'


ii. How do you declare the type of value that a function returns?

You use a return arrow, ->, to declare the type of value the function returns. Ex: '-> String' 

iii. How could you use argument labels to help clean up your code or make it more readable?

You could make a function be called in a sentence-like manner, which makes your code easier to understand (it allows for more specificity).
